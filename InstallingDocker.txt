Install Docker:
On Mac: https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
On Windows: https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20for%20Windows%20Installer.exe
On Linux don't use packages with the machine.  use the script from get.docker.com  and pipe it to bash to setup the repositories for your distribution
Then install Docker-compose from: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Docker has great documentation and examples on http://docs.docker.com

On linux to test running elastic you can just clone the repository at https://github.com/HASecuritySolutions/elastic_stack.git

In the readme it gives the instructions to get the elastic stack up and running pretty easily.

In the presentation I will talk about getting the elastic stack up and running and do a small demo.
